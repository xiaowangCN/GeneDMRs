\arguments{
\item{regiongeneall_significant}{refers to the input file of methylation levels with differentially methylated genes or the genes in different gene body features.}

\item{featurename}{refers to the feature name of the output file from Significant_filter() for genefeatureall_cpgfeature file, that is "CpGisland" or "Shore", with default NULL.}

\item{title}{refers to the figure title, with the default "Methylation level".}

\item{display_numbers}{refers to whether to display the methylation value in the figure, with default FALSE.}

\item{number_format}{refers to the displayed number of the methylation value in round format.}

\item{cluster_rows}{refers to whether to cluster the row, with the default FALSE.}

\item{cluster_cols}{refers to whether to cluster the column, with the default TRUE.}

\item{gaps_row}{refers to whether to divide the row, with the default c(1,2) that divide the rows into three parts by row 1 and row 2.}

\item{gaps_col}{refers to whether to divide the column, with the NULL.}
}
\value{
Outputs a heat map figure with methylation levels.
}
\description{
This function outputs the heat map plot for methylation level in different chromosomes of differentially methylated genes with features based on R package pheatmap.
