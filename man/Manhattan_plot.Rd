\title{Manhattan plot for all cytosines or regions.}
\usage{
Manhattan_plot(
  siteall_Qvalue,
  chrlabs = NULL,
  col = c("black", "grey"),
  ylab = "-log(Q value)",
  suggestiveline = -log10(0.01),
  genomewideline = -log10(0.001)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{siteall_Qvalue}{refers to the input file with Q value from DMR_test(), e.g., regiongeneall_Qvalues, genefeatureall_cpgfeature_Qvalue or others with Q values.}

\item{chrlabs}{refers to the label of chromosomes, with default NULL.}

\item{col}{refers to the color of plots, with default black and grey.}

\item{suggestiveline}{refers to the significant line, with default 0.01.}

\item{genomewideline}{refers to the genome-wide significant line, with default 0.001.}
}
\value{
Outputs a Manhattan figure with Q values.
}
\description{
This function outputs the Manhattan plot for all cytosines or regions in different chromosomes with significant line based on R package qqman.
}
\examples{
