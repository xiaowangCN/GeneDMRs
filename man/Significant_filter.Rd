\title{Filter the significant regions or cytosine sites.}
\usage{
Significant_filter(
  genefeatureall_cpgfeature_Qvalue,
  qvalue = 0.01,
  methdiff = 0,
  featureout = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genefeatureall_cpgfeature_Qvalue}{refers to the input file with Q values and methylation differences need to be filtered.}

\item{qvalue}{refers to the threshold of Q values that Q values larger than this will be discarded, with default 0.01.}

\item{methdiff}{refers to the threshold of methylation differences that methylation differences less than this will be discarded, with the default 0.}

\item{featureout}{refers to which feature will be filtered, with default 1. When featureout = 2, it means that the second feature will be filtered and outputted.}
}
\value{
Outputs a data frame of the significant regions or cytosine sites.
}
\description{
This function filters significant regions or cytosine sites based on Q value and methylation difference.
