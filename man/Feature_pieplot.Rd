\alias{Feature_pieplot}
\title{Pie plot based on different features.}
\usage{
Feature_pieplot(
  siteall_significant_feature,
  methdirection = "both",
  title = "Pie plot for feature",
  threeDplot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{siteall_significant_feature}{refers to the input file with features, mainly for DMC sites with features.}

\item{methdirection}{refers to the methylation direction when the input file contains the methylation difference column i.e., Methdiff1 after Logic_regression(), 
which can be "hypo", "hyper" and "both", with the default "both" for both directions.}

\item{title}{refers to figure titles, with the default "Pie plot for chromosome".}

\item{threeDplot}{refers to whether to pie plot in three dimensions based on R pacakge plotrix, with the default TRUE.}
}
\value{
Outputs a pie figure in different features.
}
\description{
This function outputs the pie plot of feature percentages in gene body or CpG island mainly for DMC sites with features.
