\title{Internal Use Function
That calculates the mean methylation difference.}
\usage{
Meth_mean(inputmethfile_QC, regionchr, cpgifeaturefile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{inputmethfile_QC}{refers to the inputmethfile after quality control.}

\item{regionchr}{refers to the filtered subset of inputrefseqfile or inputcpgifile.}

\item{cpgifeaturefile}{refers to the whether have inputcpgifeaturefile or not.}
}
\value{
Outputs the mean methylation.
}
\description{
This function calculates the mean methylation difference along each read gene.
Formula:The mean methylation of a gene of one treatment group was calculated by:
E((E[MR]_ij )/(E[TR]_ij ))*W_ij and W_ij =  (E[TR]_ij )/(EE[TR]_ij ),
where [MR]_ij and [TR]_ij are methylated and total reads number of the involved CpG/DMC j at a given gene of individual i,
n is the total individual number of one treatment group, m is total number of CpG/DMC involved in this gene and
W_ij is the weight of reads of the involved CpG/DMC j of individual i.
Firstly calculate methylation difference through reads of all cytosines along gene
Secondly calculate methylation difference along each group
When provide inputcpgifeaturefile to calculate the gene mean methylation difference ,
two features will be combined that CpG island and CpG island shore.
