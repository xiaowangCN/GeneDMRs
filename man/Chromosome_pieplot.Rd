\name{Chromosome_pieplot}
\alias{Chromosome_pieplot}
\title{Pie plot based on different chromosomes.}
\usage{
Chromosome_pieplot(
  genefeatureall_cpgfeature_significantcpgisland,
  genefeatureall_cpgfeature_significantshore = NULL,
  methdirection = "both",
  title = "Pie plot for chromosome"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{genefeatureall_cpgfeature_significantcpgisland}{refers to the input file with chromosomes, which can be files with/without significant filter().}

\item{genefeatureall_cpgfeature_significantshore}{refers to another input file with chromosomes, e.g., genefeatureall_cpgfeature_significantshore file for comparison, with default NULL.}

\item{methdirection}{refers to the methylation direction when the input file contains the methylation difference column i.e., Methdiff1 after Logic_regression(), 
which can be "hypo", "hyper" and "both", with the default "both" for both directions.}

\item{title}{refers to figure titles, with the default "Pie plot for chromosome".}
}
\value{
Outputs pie figure in different chromosomes.
}
\description{
This function outputs the pie plot for the percentages of sites or regions in different chromosomes.
